                    <p class="title is-3">How I Installed the Framework</p>
                    <p>I linked the Bulma framework to my webpage by by connecting to the CDN
                        provided by jsDelivr. To integrate Bulma's styles into my HTML document, I added a link tag
                        in the head section. This tag references the Bulma CSS file hosted on the CDN, allowing my
                        webpage to access and use Bulma's predefined CSS classes for styling.

                <div class="box">
                    <p class="title is-3">How I Built the Page</p>
                    <p>The page was structured using Bulma's predefined classes. I utilized Bulma's grid
                        system and
                        components like hero, section, columns, and box to create the layout. The hero class was used
                        for the header section, providing a prominent title and subtitle. The columns class helped
                        divide the content into three distinct sections, each represented by a column with a box for
                        clear
                        separation and styling.</p>

                <p class="title is-3">Challenges</p>
                <p>One of the issues I encountered was dealing with formatting using custom CSS and Bulma at the same
                    time. For some reason, that was causing things to be formatted very awkwardly and not the way I
                    wanted, so I opted to entirely remove the custom CSS and do all styling through Bulma. </p>
                <p>Another issue was setting font-sizes. In Bulma, setting a certain classes to be "is-*" changes the
                    font size. I assumed the higher the number, the larger the font, but it is actually the opposite.
                    Also, there was another option called is-large, but it wasn't working on all my elements. </p>
                <p>So to resolve my confusionby reading the documentation provided by Bulma to get a better
                    understanding of what their classes do. </p>
